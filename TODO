Bugs
====

 * Right now, collisions are handled such that the most recently added file
   overrides previously added files.  I'm not sure that this is correct.
 * Some tests fail intermittently because gamin doesn't seem to maintain the
   order of certain events (removing nested directories, for instance).  It's
   not really a big deal because very few people likely use gamin with pytagsfs
   (since we support inotify and kqueue, either of which is generally
   preferred over gamin), and pytagsfs has provisions to work around the
   incorrect behavior (cofirm this).


Enhancements
============

 * Reduce startup time.  One way to do this is to implement PathStore
   persistence across sessions with verification and updating of persisted data
   at mount time.
 * Improve performance of most filesystem operations.
 * It should be possible for write support to work with the dummy source tree
   monitor.
 * Allow source tree monitors to be specified on the command-line by nick-name
   ("dummy"), instead of class name.
 * Implement source tree monitor based on python-fam?
 * Add more special files:
    - .collisions: lists virtual paths that collide and the source files they
      corespond with.
    - .missing: lists source paths that are not representable as virtual files.
 * Should verbosity=debug include library debug messages (normally sent to
   stderr)?
 * Re-examine format string conditional expression syntax.  I've received
   complaints that the %?foo%:bar%? syntax is overly verbose and awkward.  This
   is probably true, but it also prevents nested conditionals, which is nice.
 * Warn user of performance penalty associated -d/-o debug?


Testing
=======

 * Test dummy source tree monitor.
 * Test -o uid, -o gid.
 * Test -r, -o ro, -o rdonly.
 * Test pytags utility.
